        <h1>The Carbon Footprint of Trade</h1>
        <p>This project investigates the environmental impact of international trade in OECD countries. Utilizing data from the OECD, we analyzed carbon emissions embodied in both import and export activities. The findings revealed stark differences between OECD and non-OECD countries, with critical implications for future trade policies.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Trade has played a crucial role in shaping global economic policies, but it also significantly impacts environmental sustainability. In this project, we aim to measure the carbon footprint of trade and examine how trade activities affect carbon emissions differently between OECD and non-OECD countries.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>One of the main challenges was gathering and harmonizing data from different countries, as emission standards and trade policies vary. We tackled this by using data normalization techniques and adopting a common analytical framework across all datasets.</p>

        <h2>Technologies and Tools Used</h2>
        <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Data Visualization, Environmental Analysis, International Trade Data</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tableau</p>

        <h2>Key Results</h2>
        <p>The project revealed substantial differences in the carbon footprint of trade between OECD and non-OECD countries, providing crucial insights for shaping future environmental policies related to international trade.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As a result of our findings, we highlight the need for stricter international regulations on carbon emissions, particularly in relation to trade activities, to ensure sustainable economic growth while minimizing the environmental impacts of global trade.</p>
