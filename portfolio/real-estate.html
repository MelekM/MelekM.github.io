    <h1>The Multifamily Real Estate Development Process</h1>
    <p>This project presents an optimization framework to evaluate the feasibility of multifamily real estate development. Using data from Austin, TX, the framework helps predict the optimal number of units that are likely to receive approval from city councils based on characteristics of nearby properties.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The goal of the project was to create an optimization tool that evaluates the development potential of land parcels in Austin, TX, and predicts the number of residential units likely to receive approval.</p>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
    <p>The biggest challenge was identifying the most critical features influencing the development approval process. We addressed this by analyzing previously approved developments and using machine learning to determine feature importance.</p>

    <h2>Technologies and Tools Used</h2>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Optimization, Real Estate Development, Data Analysis</p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Scikit-Learn, Linear Programming</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The optimization model provided accurate predictions for the number of units likely to be approved, offering valuable insights for multifamily real estate developers during the feasibility analysis stage.</p>
