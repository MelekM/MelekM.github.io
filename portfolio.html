            <h2><a href="/projects/carbon-footprint.html" target="_blank">The Carbon Footprint of Trade</a></h2>
            <p>
                This project investigates the environmental impact of international trade in OECD countries. Utilizing data from the OECD, we analyzed carbon emissions embodied in both import and export activities. The findings revealed stark differences between OECD and non-OECD countries, with critical implications for future trade policies.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Data Visualization, Environmental Analysis, International Trade Data.</p>
