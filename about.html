      <p>Hello, I'm Melek Mizher, a passionate technologist, data scientist, and photographer.
        I have a diverse background in biomedical science and technology, and I'm always
        eager to explore new ways of combining creativity with technical innovation.</p>

  <!-- Professional Journey Section -->
  <section id="professional-journey">
    <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
    <p>My journey started with a strong passion for technology, and I've since earned a Master's
      degree in Data Science/AI from a top U.S. university. I have a deep understanding of using
      big data to solve scientific and technical problems, from optimizing protein structures to
      creating financial models. I have worked as a biomedical scientist and developed strong
      analytical and programming skills over the years.</p>

    <p>During my studies, I also developed a passion for algorithmic problem-solving, which
      I explored further in group projects such as 'Washington State Algorithmic Redistricting.'
      My experience spans different sectors, including medical technologies and computational biology,
      making me well-rounded in data science and analytics.</p>

  <section id="personal-interests">
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>When I'm not immersed in data or working on projects, I indulge in photography. I discovered
      my love for capturing the world through a lens during a family trip to Syria, and since then,
      it's become one of my greatest passions. You can view some of my favorite photos in the
      <a href="#photography.html">Photography</a> section of my portfolio.</p>

    <p>I’m also a language enthusiast! Growing up bilingual in Spanish and Arabic, I later
      picked up English, Portuguese, and even Turkish. I’m currently learning Dutch, as my
      fiancée's family resides in the Netherlands.</p>

  <!-- Values and Vision Section -->
  <section id="values-vision">
    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>At the core of everything I do is a desire to learn, grow, and make a positive impact.
      Whether it's solving a complex data problem or capturing a fleeting moment with my camera,
      I am constantly seeking new challenges and ways to expand my horizons.</p>

    <p>In the future, I hope to combine my skills in data science and technology with my passion
      for photography and storytelling, creating innovative solutions that blend art and science
      in meaningful ways.</p>
