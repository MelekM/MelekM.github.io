    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>At the core of everything I do is a desire to learn, grow, and make a positive impact.
      Whether it's solving a complex data problem or capturing a fascinating view with my camera,
      I am constantly seeking new challenges and ways to expand my horizons.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>In the future, I hope to use my creative side and passion for photography and storytelling,
      together with innovative solutions that blend reality and modern technologies in meaningful ways.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>I am very passionate about technology. Since an early age, I was passionate
      about video games which provided me with my first exposure to code. Developing
      an online server and modifying a game using a language derived from C.
      This helped me gain my initial exposure to programming, which then eventually grew
      into a larger passion about technology.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I became very interested in the prospect of using computers to discover solutions
      to problems as I advanced in my undergraduate education as a Biomedical Scientist with
      original aims of continuing into Medical School. During my time at UCF, I discovered
      a passion for Data by suggestion of a professor that was very interested in the use of
      big data to solve scientific problems, specially as related to chemical and protein
      structures, and uncovering insights from genetic information.</p>

    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>It was during a trip to my family's homeland in Syria that I discovered my
      passion about photography. In 2011, with the civil war already raging on, my grandfather
      had fallen ill and due to him having a low likelihood for recovering we traveled to
      get a chance to see him. We visited his small farm on the hills to the east of the city,
      an area higher in elevation which gave us relief from the warm weather of that summer.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>At that time, the iPhone 3G had recently been released, and I was in possession of one,
      so I took advantage of that and snapped a few pictures, so I wouldn't forget the travel.
      When I took the picture of the cherries on the branch, I got very excited about my picture,
      which is still one of the pictures I hold dear to my heart as it brings me a memory of my grandfather.</p>

    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <p>Growing up in a bilingual Spanish-Arabic speaking family, I learned
      the language of my family while living abroad. I was gifted an Arabic reading book by my great-grandmother
      in 2004 when I was an 8-year-old. Ever since that time I managed to dedicate time to my love for
      languages. I then started learning English, although I had a difficult time during my middle school
      years. Being exposed to the internet and building friendships online helped me quickly
      develop an advanced level of English. By the time my family immigrated to the United States,
      I was already a fluent English-speaker, although I needed some work fine-tuning my
      ears to the variety of accents I was to encounter.</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Later on, I picked up Portuguese through my own personal studies (thanks, Duolingo),
      and intermediate French from my college education which I also studied
      plentifully in my own time, having read books as L'étranger by Albert Camus in the original French.
      Then, due to my name Melek meaning Owner/King in Arabic, yet Angel in Turkish, it turned out
      that Turkish people would be very curious as to my origin, which led me to form a lot
      of friendships with people from Turkey. This eventually turned into being fully fluent
      in Turkish to the point that when I travel to Turkey, the question is not "Where are you from?"
      but rather "Where did you complete your military service at?" Seeing as Turkey has
      compulsory military service for all male citizens. Later on, I started learning Dutch due to
      my frequent travels to the Netherlands, where my fiancée's family resides.</p>
