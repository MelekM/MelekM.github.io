        <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>I am very passionate about technology. Since an early age, I was passionate
            about video games which provided me with my first exposure to code. Developing
            an online server and designing it using PAWN which is a language derived from C.
            This helped me gain my initial exposure to programming, which then eventually grew
            into a larger passion about technology.</p>
            <p>I became very interested in the prospect of using computers to discover solutions
            to problems as I advanced in my undergraduate education as a Biomedical Scientist with
            original aims of continuing into Medical School. During my time at UCF, I discovered
            a passion for Data by suggestion of a professor that was very interested in the use of
            big data to solve scientific problems, specially as related to chemical and protein
            structures, and uncovering insights from genetic information.</p>

        <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>It was during a trip to my family's homeland in Syria that I discovered my
            passion about photography. In 2011, with the civil war already raging on, my grandfather
            had fallen ill and due to him having a low likelihood for recovering we traveled to
            get a chance to see him. Two hours before our arrival in As Suwayda, he had fallen
            into a comma from which he would not recover. In the following days after his passing, we
            visited many people from our family whom I had never met before. On a few instances, we
            visited his small farm on the hills to the east of the city, an area higher in elevation
            which gave us relief from the warm weather of that summer.</p>
            <p>At that time, the iPhone 3G had recently been released, and I was in possession of one,
            so I took advantage of that and snapped a few pictures, so I wouldn't forget the memories
            I had been building of my travel. When I was able to detail the picture of the cherries on
            the branch, I got very excited about my picture, which is still one of the pictures I hold
            dear to my heart, and bringing me a memory of my grandfather all at once.</p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>
            <p>Growing up in a bilingual Spanish-Arabic speaking family, I was challenged to learn
            the language of my family while living abroad. I was gifted an Arabic reading book by my great-grandmother
            in 2004 when I was an 8-year-old. Ever since that time I managed to dedicate time to my love for
            languages. I then started learning English, although I had a difficult time during my middle school
            years. Being exposed to the internet and building friendships online helped me quickly
            develop an advanced level of English. By the time my family immigrated to the United States,
            I was already a fluent English-speaker, although I needed some work fine-tuning my
            ears to the variety of accents I was to encounter.</p>
            <p>Later on, I picked up Portuguese through my own personal studies (thanks Duolingo),
            and intermediate French from my college education which I also studied
            plentifully in my own time, having read books as L'étranger by Albert Camus in the original French.
            Then, due to my name Melek meaning Owner/King in Arabic, yet Angel in Turkish, it turned out
            that Turkish people would be very curious as to my origin, which led me to form a lot
            of friendships with people from Turkey. This eventually turned into being fully fluent
            in Turkish to the point that when I travel to Turkey, the question is not "Where are you from?"
            but rather "Where did you complete your military service at?" Seeing as Turkey has
            compulsory military service for all male citizens. Later on, I started learning Dutch due to
            my frequent travels to the Netherlands, where my fiancée's family resides.</p>
