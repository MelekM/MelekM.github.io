            <p>Hello, I'm Melek Mizher, a passionate technologist, data scientist, and photographer.
                I have a diverse background in biomedical science and technology, and I'm always
                eager to explore new ways of combining creativity with technical innovation.</p>

    <!-- Professional Journey Section -->

        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>My journey started with a strong passion for technology, and I've since earned a Master's
            degree in Data Science/AI from a top U.S. university. I have a deep understanding of using
            big data to solve scientific and technical problems, from optimizing protein structures to
            creating financial models. I have worked as a biomedical scientist and developed strong
            analytical and programming skills over the years.</p>

        <p>During my studies, I also developed a passion for algorithmic problem-solving, which
            I explored further in group projects such as 'Washington State Algorithmic Redistricting.'
            My experience spans different sectors, including medical technologies and computational biology,
            making me well-rounded in data science and analytics.</p>

    <!-- Personal Interests Section -->
    <section id="personal-interests">
        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in data or working on projects, I indulge in photography. I discovered
            my love for capturing the world through a lens during a family trip to Syria, and since then,
            it's become one of my greatest passions. You can view some of my favorite photos in the
            <a href="/photography.html">Photography</a> section of my portfolio.</p>

        <p>I’m also a language enthusiast! Growing up bilingual in Spanish and Arabic, I later
            picked up English, Portuguese, and even Turkish. I’m currently learning Dutch, as my
            fiancée's family resides in the Netherlands.</p>
