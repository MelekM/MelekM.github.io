        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My journey into data science began with a passion for technology and problem-solving,
            which led me to earn a Master's degree in Data Science/AI from Northwestern University.
            I specialize in using data to generate insights and develop solutions. I’ve worked on projects ranging from algorithmic optimization to predictive modeling,
            focusing on applying data analytics and visualization to solve real-world challenges.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
            During my studies, I developed a strong interest in algorithmic problem-solving,
            applying this to the projects displayed in this portfolio. I’ve worked on optimizing
            processes, creating efficient algorithms, and tackling real-world problems through data-driven
            methods. These projects helped refine my approach to problem-solving, from initial data collection
            to deploying solutions. This has allowed me to refine my skills across diverse fields,
            giving me a well-rounded understanding of data science and its applications.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>
            My expertise extends to big data analysis, creating models, and using data-driven approaches
            to tackle complex issues. I’ve developed a strong foundation in machine learning, statistical analysis,
            and data visualization, which I’ve applied across projects from multiple fields. Whether it’s optimizing processes
            or uncovering insights from complex datasets, I’m passionate about leveraging data science to drive
            impactful solutions and innovation.

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>When I'm not immersed in data or a project, I enjoy photography, video games, and sports.
            I discovered my love for capturing the world through a lens during a childhood family trip,
            and since then, it's become one of my greatest passions. You can view some of my favorite
            photos in the <a href="/photography.html">Photography</a> section.</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>I’m a language enthusiast. Growing up bilingual in Spanish and Arabic, I later
            picked up English, Portuguese, and Turkish. I’m currently learning Dutch, as my
            fiancée's family resides in the Netherlands.</p>
